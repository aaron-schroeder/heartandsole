# fitanalysis
fitanalysis is a Python library for analysis of ANT/Garmin `.fit` files.

It's geared toward cycling and allows for easy extraction of data such as the following from a `.fit` file:
- elapsed time
- moving time
- average heart rate
- average power
- weighted normalized power (based on information publicly available about TrainingPeaks' NP®)
- intensity (based on information publicly available about TrainingPeaks' IF®)
- training stress (based on information publicly available about TrainingPeaks' TSS®)
