    See (Coggan, 2003) cited in README for details on the rationale behind the

    Normalized power is based on a 30-second moving average of power. Coggan's
    algorithm specifies that the moving average should start at the 30 second
    point in the data, but this implementation does not (it starts with the
    first value, like a standard moving average). This is an acceptable
    approximation because normalized power shouldn't be relied upon for efforts
    less than 20 minutes long (Coggan, 2012), so how the first 30 seconds are
    handled doesn't make much difference. Also, the values computed by this
    implementation are very similar to those computed by TrainingPeaks, so
    changing the moving average implementation doesn't seem to be critical.

    This function also does not specially handle gaps in the data. When a pause
    is present in the data (either from autopause on the recording device or
    removal of stopped periods in post-processing) the timestamp may jump by a
    large amount from one sample to the next. Ideally this should be handled in
    some way that takes into account the physiological impact of that rest, but
    currently this algorithm does not. But again, the values computed by this
    implementation are very similar to those computed by TrainingPeaks, so
    changing gap handling doesn't seem to be critical.
